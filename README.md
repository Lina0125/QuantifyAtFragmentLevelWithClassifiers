# 2 parts are included in this project
## 1)Models generation
Model generation is done manually on jupyter notebook and is not written into pipeline
## 2)Fragment ranking and protein quantify algrithm

## Pipelines
Useful workflow includes the generalized OpenSWATH workflow and the optimized OpenSWATH workflow which combine OpenSWATH, pyProphet and a python package which used to combine classifier and q value calculation algorithm(gscore) to score fragment ions.

## Main modules
### The generalized OpenSWATH workflow
OpenSWATH + pyProphet + TRIC

### the optimized OpenSWATH workflow
OpenSWATH + pyProphet
Generated classifiers
python package that used to quantify protein at fragment level
